## Overview
This project aims to analyze e-commerce sales data stored in a MySQL database. Using Jupyter Notebook, we perform SQL queries to extract insights from the data and visualize them using charts and graphs.

## Features
- Data querying with MYSQL in Jupyter Notebook.
- Data visualization using charts and graphs.
- Insights gained from the analysis.

## Technologies Used
- MySQL for database management.
- Jupyter Notebook for data analysis and visualization.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for creating visualizations.

## Installation and Setup
To set up the project environment:

- Install MySQL and Jupyter Notebook.
- Install required Python libraries:
```
import os

import numpy as np

import pandas as pd

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

import seaborn as sns
import mysql.connector
from dotenv import load_dotenv
```

- Configure database connection details in Jupyter Notebook.


## Data Exploration
The dataset contains information about e-commerce sales, including customer details. Here's a sample of the records:

| CustomerID | FirstName | LastName | Email       | Phone  | Address | State |
|---------|------------|-----------|-------------------|------------|----------|-------|
